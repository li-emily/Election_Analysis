# Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this election audit was to get familiar with using Python programming. We learned about the basics of creating and executing Python files, different data types, and performing calculations. Additionally, we also became familiar with data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and reviewed concepts from previous VBA experience, like for loops.
